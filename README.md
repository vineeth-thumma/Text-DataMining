# Text Data Mining

The aim is to build a Document Classifier using different classification algorithms and compare their accuracy and scalability.
The documents dataset is split into training and testing sets to build and validate the model respectively.

The classifiers used are:
-Navie Bayes classifier
-Decision Tree classifier
-K-Nearest Neighbors classifier
-Apriori Algorithm (classification by generating Association Rules)
  
Calculated similarity between the documents using Min-wise Hashing. The efficacy and efficiency of the Min-Hash sketch is evaluated by comparing it with Jaccard similarity which is the true similarity baseline.
